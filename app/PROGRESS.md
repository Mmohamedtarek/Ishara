# Progress

## Phase 0: setup, read, report (2026-10-08)

**Built:** `CLAUDE.md`, `app/tools/strip_prototype.py`, `app/PHASE0-REPORT.md`, `.gitignore` entry for `app/tools/out/`. No app code.

| Checklist (source: user prompt, Phase 0) | Status |
|---|---|
| 0.1 List missing tools and give install commands, no sudo run | ✓ (report §0.1). `flutter doctor -v` **not run yet**: Flutter is not installed, and the disk has only 7.9 GB free |
| 0.2 `CLAUDE.md` with sources, never-change list, review protocol, sign rules, ask-don't-guess | ✓ |
| Prototype read via a re-runnable strip script in `app/tools/` | ✓ (`python3 app/tools/strip_prototype.py`; 2 GLBs, glTF magic checked) |
| 0.3.1 Screen map | ✓ |
| 0.3.2 Avatar engine | ✓ |
| 0.3.3 Sign mismatches (7 confirmed + 14 new) | ✓ |
| 0.3.4 Avatar vs vocabulary v2 table | ✓ from keyframe data. The visual check is planned for Step 5 |
| 0.3.5 Architecture, packages, Firestore model | ✓ |
| 0.3.6 Wrong / contradictory sources | ✓ (C1–C15) |

**Tests:** none (no app code yet). **Screenshots:** static screens rendered with headless Chrome for comparison (scratchpad only).

**Open questions:** all of `PHASE0-REPORT.md` §7. Waiting for the user.
